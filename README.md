## Xieon's Gaming Corner Public Archival Fork 
[![Discord Widget](https://discord.com/api/guilds/829181609156411463/widget.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/Xieon)

* This fork is a public archival fork of TeraFinder - there's been no changes done by Xieon's Gaming Corner other than image compression, and data compression by Github action algorithms - this fork is kept as up to date as possible with the main branch 

### XGC's Latest Release Build of Tera Finder:
The latest TeraFinder release on XGC's Github is 06172025 - Starting with this release, after fixing issues with the workflow file, compiling can be done using Github Actions instead of needing to download, and compile the code yourself. I have included the artifacts created from the most recent release PR. There are now two zips being ``TeraFinder.Plugins.Zip`` and ``TeraFinder.Launcher.Zip`` with the release version appended to the end. 

You can simply download the zip file from the release and run TeraFinder right away without needing to compile it yourself. You can find these Zips in the [Latest Release 06172025v1](https://github.com/Xieons-Gaming-Corner/Tera-Finder/releases/tag/06_17_2025v1)
Below is a screenshot of the contents of ``TeraFinderLauncher.Zip`` - Running ``TeraFinder.Launcher.exe`` is how to start the TeraFinder program. 
Extract the entire contents of the zip to the same directory before launching the ``.exe`` file.
